## EasiDial Care - Saving Lives Through Easy Access to Medical Care

Welcome to the EasiDial Care GitHub Page, an innovative app project that aims to make accessing medical care and saving lives easier than ever before.
We believe that quick and reliable access to healthcare services is crucial, especially in emergency situations. With EasiDial Care, we provide a user-friendly platform that enables individuals to find the nearest hospitals and obtain contact information for their ambulances, making it a vital tool for communities.

## Project Overview:
EasiDial Care focuses on providing essential information about nearby hospitals and their ambulance services. Our app not only displays the locations of the closest hospitals on an interactive map but also offers contact details, ensuring that users can quickly and efficiently reach out for medical assistance when needed. By leveraging the power of technology, we aim to streamline the process of accessing healthcare, potentially saving lives in critical situations.
